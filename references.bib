    abstract = {Constrained-surface-based stereolithography has recently attracted much attention from both academic and industrial communities. Despite numerous experimental, numerical and theoretical efforts, the fundamental need to reduce the separation force between the newly cured part and constrained surface has not yet been completely solved. In this paper, we develop a ﬂuid dynamics approach, proposed in our previous work, to theoretically model the separation force in 3D printing of a cylindrical part for ﬂat and patterned windows. We demonstrate the possibility of separation force reduction with an accelerated movement of the printing platform. In particular, we investigate behaviors of transient parameter, its reduction rate, and separation force reduction with respect to elevation speed and time. The proposed approach involves deceleration and acceleration stages and allows to achieve the force reduction for the entire printing process. Finally, we provide implicit analytical solutions for time moments when switching between the stages can be done without noticeable increase of separation force and explicit expression for separation force in case of patterned window.},
