	abstract = {Projection micro stereolithography ({PµSL}) is an additive manufacturing tool that offers multiple advantages, including unparalleled resolution and throughput, but the ability to print high viscosity resin for large-scale parts is limited. One of the key challenges in {PµSL} is to separate a newly polymerized layer from the vat floor without damaging the part. Since the separation force scales with the printing area, the risk of damaging the part increases significantly with larger-scale systems and must be addressed. In this paper, a novel roll-to-roll, variable tensioning system is proposed to reduce the separation force during printing. A mathematical model is proposed to predict the separation force for different 2D geometries, and a set of experiments is conducted on an experimental prototype to validate the model. The effects of different separation parameters including peel rate and peel angle are discussed in detail. The results show that the proposed tensioning system reduces the separation force significantly.},

In constrained surface projection {SL} systems, the separation of a newly cured layer from the constrained surface is a historical technical barrier. It greatly limits printable size, process reliability and print speed. Moreover, over-large separation force leads to adhesion failures in manufacturing processes, causing broken constrained surface and part defects. Against this background, this paper investigates the formation of separation forces and various factors that affect the separation process in constrained surface projection {SL} systems.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing ({AM}), which is also referred to as 3D printing, is a class of manufacturing techniques that fabricate three dimensional (3D) objects by accumulating materials. Constrained surface based stereolithography is one of the most widely used {AM} techniques. In the process, a thin layer of liquid photosensitive resin is constrained between a constrained surface and the platform or part. The light penetrates the transparent constrained surface and cures that layer of liquid polymer. Then the platform is moved up to separate the newly cured layer to let new liquid resin ﬁll into the gap and get cured. The separation of newly cured layer from the constrained surface is a grand challenge that limits the printable size and printing speed in this manufacturing technique. Numerous experimental works have been performed to understand how to reduce the separation force in the process. In this paper we study a new design of constrained surface with radial groove texture that signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the effectiveness of reduction of the separation force and hence the manufacturing capability via theoretical modeling. In particular, we investigate the inﬂuence of groove shape, groove depth and the number of grooves on the separation force. The proposed model is validated with numerical simulations demonstrating an excellent agreement. We demonstrate the possibility of drastic reduction of the separation force (up to 112\%) via surface texturing of the permeable window for continuous 3D printing.},

	abstract = {In constrained-surface projection stereolithography process, significant separation force is required to separate the cured part from the bottom surface of the resin tank, which reduces the throughput and accuracy of the process. To reduce separation force and improve printing efficiency and printing accuracy, in this study, photosensitive/thermosetting resin was used as the printing material, and the relationship between the resin curing degree and separation force was investigated. On this basis, a low adhesion continuous constrainedsurface projection stereolithography process based on curing degree control was proposed. By adjusting the ratio of the composite resin to control the curing degree of the resin during the printing process, thereby the Young’s modulus of the cured resin layer was temporarily reduced, the separation force between the cured part and the bottom of the resin tank was weakened, which thus realized the continuous printing of resin. Then the final mechanical properties of the entire part are improved by thermal curing. The results show that compared with pure photosensitive resin, when the thermosetting resin content is 70\%, the separation force can be reduced by 95.7\%, the volume shrinkage can be reduced by 64.5\%. The maximum tensile strength after post-curing of the printing part is 71 {MPa}, and the maximum tensile modulus after post-curing the printing part is 997 {MPa}. This process results in enhanced part printing accuracy, and the maximum speed can reach up to 1080 mm/h. The above results indicate that this new continuous 3D printing method via curing degree control provides a new avenue to fabricate part with high efficiency toward functional applications.},

In this paper, we develop a ﬂuid dynamics approach, proposed in our previous work, to theoretically model the separation force in 3D printing of a cylindrical part for ﬂat and patterned windows. We demonstrate the possibility of separation force reduction with an accelerated movement of the printing platform. In particular, we investigate behaviors of transient parameter, its reduction rate, and separation force reduction with respect to elevation speed and time. The proposed approach involves deceleration and acceleration stages and allows to achieve the force reduction for the entire printing process. Finally, we provide implicit analytical solutions for time moments when switching between the stages can be done without noticeable increase of separation force and explicit expression for separation force in case of patterned window.},

	abstract = {The two most basic viscoelastic models, Voigt–Kelvin and Maxwell, were applied to a mechanical model of the peel strength application test of adhesives. Previous models treated the adhesives as elastic solids, but this is the first correct analytical viscoelastic treatment of an adhesive as well as the first analytical solutions for the stresses of both a Voigt–Kelvin element and a Maxwell element strained at a constant pull rate. With these solutions, both models produced experimentally relevant results for pressure-sensitive adhesives, whereby the peel strength generally decreases with the shear storage modulus and increases with the shear loss modulus, depending on the initial framework and parameters. In addition, the peel strength is highly dependent on the surface break stress, and an intermediate value of 106 Pa for the Voigt–Kelvin model and a high value of 6.5 × 107 Pa for the Maxwell model produce peel strength values around 102–104 N/m, which is consistent with most pressure-sensitive adhesives. Furthermore, the presence of the break stress also causes discontinuities in the effects of shear moduli. More broadly, the dependence of peel strength on the shear modulus is highly nonlinear for both models, which explains the difficulty in the empirical correlation of the two. However, either of these models could provide a means to achieve such a correlation in order to understand how to simultaneously adjust the shear storage and loss moduli to increase the peel strength.},

	abstract = {Constrained-surface based Additive Manufacturing ({AM}) processes have been widely used in both academia and industry for the past few years. Despite the advantages of constrained-surface based {AM} processes, it has not been widely used in practice. A main reason for this is that a substantial separation force is required to separate the cured part from the material vat during the pulling-up stage, which may damage the cured part and reduce the reliability of the process. The solutions proposed previously to reduce this separation force recommend using an intermediate coating material (e.g., Teflon and silicone films) between the cured part and the vat. This, however, has only negligible effects in reducing the separation force. In this work, the pulling-up process is modeled within the framework of mechanics-based principles. In particular, the cohesive zone model ({CZM}) is adopted to characterize the separation mechanism, and finite element ({FE}) simulation is carried out to investigate the separation process using the commercially available {FE} software, Abaqus. A new simple optimization scheme is also proposed to estimate the constitutive cohesive stiffness parameters from experimental measurements. These constitutive parameters are very difficult to estimate using the standard mechanical tests. The proposed work based on sound mechanics-based principles can be used for reliable prediction of pulling-up speed, and thus, is likely to be useful in devising an adaptive closed-loop system to control the pulling-up process and achieve a reliable {AM} approach.},

	abstract = {The low productivity of typical 3D printing is a major hurdle for its utilization in large-scale manufacturing. Innovative techniques have been developed to break the limitation of printing speed, however, sophisticated facilities or costly consumables are required, which still substantially restricts the economic efficiency. Here we report that a common stereolithographic 3D printing facility can achieve a very high printing speed (400 mm/h) using a green and inexpensive hydrogel as a separation interface against the cured part. In sharp contrast to other techniques, the unique separation mechanism relies on the large recoverable deformation along the thickness direction of the hydrogel interface during the layer-wise printing. The hydrogel needs to be extraordinarily soft and unusually thick to remarkably reduce the adhesion force which is a key factor for achieving rapid 3D printing. This technique shows excellent printing stability even for fabricating large continuous solid structures, which is extremely challenging for other rapid 3D printing techniques. The printing process is highly robust for fabricating diversified materials with various functions. With the advantages mentioned above, the presented technique is believed to make a large impact on large-scale manufacturing., The commercial application of 3D printing is limited by time constraints and current efforts to speed the process are economically inefficient. Here the authors report on the use of a green and inexpensive hydrogel to separate the interface and cured components in common stereolithographic processes to allow for rapid printing.},

It is found that both the viscoelastic properties of the film and the interfacial adhesive contribute to the rate-dependent peel-off force. For a fixed peeling rate, the peel-off force decreases with the increasing peeling angle. Increasing film thickness or substrate roughness leads to an increase of the peel-off force. Viscoelastic energy release rate in the present experiment can be further predicted by adopting a recently published theoretical model. It is shown that the energy release rate increases with the increase of peeling rates or peeling angles.

	abstract = {In the processing of the bottom-exposure stereolithography system, the curing photopolymer will connect to the resin tank as well as the upper layer. After the exposure of each layer, the forming platform has to be levered up and resin can flow into the gap between the completed layers and the resin tank. During the pulling up stage, the cured layer might not levitate together with the above layers but break and stay on the bottom of the resin tank. In order to conquer the pulling failure, a great amount of over curing is necessary to gain enough bonding force between the new exposure layer and the above layers. This over curing will cause decline of accuracy. In this paper, a super elastic intermediate material has been introduced to minimize the pulling force. The super elastic and shear strength property can help to break the vacuum between the new exposure layer and the resin tank. By the reduction of the pulling force, the amount of over curing requirement can also be reduced. Formulation of the cured forming shape and the pulling force has been proposed. The result shows that only area size is important. Hence, the pulling force can be predicted and used in on-line monitoring of the fabrication process.},

	abstract = {The vat photopolymerization technology is widely employed in additive manufacturing due to its high printing accuracy and rapid fabrication speed. However, the layer-by-layer curing process of the bottom-up vat photopolymerization method inherently generates significant separation force, which occurs during the detachment of each cured layer from the interface, often leading to structural failure or printing defects. The regulation of exposure energy during the printing process critically influences the magnitude of the separation force. However, the underlying mechanism governing the relationship between the exposure energy and separation force remains insufficiently understood. To address this, the present study systematically investigates the behavior of the separation force under varying exposure energies and elucidates the mechanism through an adhesion energy equilibrium analysis. Furthermore, an effective interface optimization strategy─hollow air film─is proposed. This strategy reduces the adhesion energy contact area through a flexible peeling mechanism, thereby significantly lowering the separation force. This research provides fundamental insights into the regulation of exposure energy and separation force in vat photopolymerization, offering crucial advancements for enhancing printing quality and process efficiency.},
